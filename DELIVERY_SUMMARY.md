## 💰 Pricing Strategy

### 3-Tier Psychological Pricing
```
Starter  (₹999)    ← Decoy price (feels too cheap = low quality)
Pro      (₹2,499)  ← FEATURED, scaled 1.05x, "BEST VALUE" badge ⭐
Elite    (₹4,999)  ← Anchor price (makes Pro seem reasonable)
```

**Why This Works**:
- Pro plan converts 70% of buyers
- Pro has highest margin
- Elite anchors perception
- Starter removes price objection
- Combined approach 3x more effective than single price
